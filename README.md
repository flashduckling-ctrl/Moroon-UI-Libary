🌑 MOROON LIB v3.0 | THE DARK NEXUS 🌑
"Stop using boring menus. Start using a masterpiece."
Are you tired of script stealers ripping your hard work? 🛑 Are you bored of UIs that look like they were made in 2015? 😴 Moroon Lib has arrived to reset the standard. Built for the elite, by the elite.
🔥 Why Moroon Lib?
• 💠 Ghost-Tier Security: Our core is heavily mangled and obfuscated. Even the best "script-scanners" will find nothing but gibberish. Your logic stays your logic. 🔐
• ⚡ Hyper-Fluid Animations: Experience dropdowns that glide, notifications that pop with 10-second persistence, and toggles that feel like premium machinery.
• 🎯 Absolute Customization: Tabs, Sliders, Switches, Keybinds, and Dropdowns—all scriptable in seconds. You name the title, you set the vibe.
• 📡 Traitor-Catching Webhooks: Someone tried to guess your Pin? You'll get their Name, UserID, and IP-location sent straight to your Discord before they can even try again. 🚨
🛠️ The Toolkit
• [X] Keybind: Instant stealth mode. Hide the menu in a blink.
• [Pin] Entry: Gatekeep your features from the "randoms."
• [Dropdown] Menus: Organized, sleek, and auto-scaling.
• [RGB] Theme Engine: Let your users paint the menu their own way.
🔄 Update Frequency
We don't sleep. Moroon Lib is a living project.
• Minor Fixes: Every 48 hours. 🛠️
• Feature Drops: Every Weekend. 🎁
• Security Patches: Instantaneous. If a bypass is found, we patch it before you even notice. 🛡️
